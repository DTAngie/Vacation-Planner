# Vacation Planner

Plan your vacation down to the day, stick your to budget, and share with family members or friends who are travelling with you.

This vacation planner is a small project that I built to learn how to put together a PERN stack. I opted not to use Sequelize CLI for database migration and seeding, so the SQL database script is in the sqlMigration.txt file.

# Ice Box:
- Refactor the routing to allow shorter urls and more dependency on state
- Prevent spamming of share function, by allowing users to accept share requests
- Add delete confirmation inside modals
